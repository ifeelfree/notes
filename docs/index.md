# Technical Note 

I use this technical note to accumulate all the knowledge I have obtained when working on different projects.

## 1. Computer Languages

### 1.1. Python

Life is short, and please use Python!

### 1.2. Markdown

Markdown's goal is to allow people “to write using an 
easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, and optionally 
convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).” 

### 1.3 CUDA

CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and programming model that lets developers use Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for general-purpose processing.

### 1.4 CMake 

CMake is cross-platform free and open-source software for build automation, testing, packaging and installation of software by using a compiler-independent method.
 
### 1.5 C++
 

## 2. Computer
### 2.1 Linux 

The first step in becoming a data scientist: forget about Windows.

### 2.2 Windows 

Windows is a computer operating system (OS) developed by Microsoft Corporation 

### 2.3 Docker 

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.

### 2.4 Popular Apps

Popular Apps include web browsing, office suites, media, creative work, productivity, and system tools. 


## 3. Software Development

### 3.1 Version Control

Version control is used to track and manage changes to files, especially code, over time.

### 3.2 Design Pattern 

A software design pattern or design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in many contexts in software design.


## 4. Machine Learning
### 4.1 Data

Data is the new oil.

### 4.2 Mlops 

MLOps stands for Machine Learning Operations. MLOps is a core function of Machine Learning engineering, focused on streamlining the process of taking machine learning models to production, and then maintaining and monitoring them.

### 4.3 Model 

A machine learning model is a file that has 
been trained to recognize certain types of patterns. 

### 4.4 TensorFlow

TensorFlow is a popular deep learning framework widely used in the industry. 

## 5. Sensors 

### 5.1 3D Sensing 

3D sensing is a depth-sensing technology that augments camera capabilities for facial and object recognition. The process of capturing a real-world object's length, width, and height with more clarity and in-depth detail than can be achieved using a number of different technologies.

### 5.2 Sensor Fusion

Sensor fusion integrates data from various sensors to enable smarter decision-making by computer systems.

## 6. Low-level Computer Vision

### 6.1 Image Construction

Image construction refers to the  computational process of generating images from raw data collected by sensors.



### 6.2 Image Quality Assessment 

Image quality assessment refers to the methods used to measure and evaluate the perceived quality of digital images,
 

## 7. Geometric Computer Vision

### 7.1 Projective Distortion Correction

Projective distortion correction is the process of digitally manipulating an image to remove the geometric distortions caused when a 3D scene is projected onto a 2D image plane from an angled viewpoint.

### 7.2 SLAM

SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) is a fundamental technology that enables an autonomous system (like a robot or drone) to build a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously determining its own precise location within that map in real-time.


## 8. Image Analysis
### 8.1 Texture Analysis

Texture analysis in image processing is the process of quantifying and characterizing the spatial arrangement and variation of pixel intensities within a digital image.

### 8.2 Image Segmentation

Image segmentation is a core computer vision technique that involves partitioning a digital image into multiple segments, or groups of pixels, to simplify its representation and make it easier to analyze.

### 8.3 Object Detection 


Object detection is a computer vision technique that allows 
us to identify and locate objects in an image or video.

## 9. Video Analysis

### 9.1 Hand Pose Estimation

Posture estimation is used to understand human's behavior. 

### 9.2 Object Tracking 

Video object tracking is a key computer vision task that involves locating a moving object (or multiple objects) over time in a sequence of video frames. 


## 10. Inspiring Life 

### 10.1 English 

English is everywhere. 


### 10.2 French 

C'est belly langue. 

### 10.3 Poems 

Poetry is a form of literary art that uses the aesthetic and often rhythmic qualities of language to evoke meanings and emotions beyond literal definitions. 

### 10.4 Cooking 

I like cooking for my families. 

### 10.5 Health 

Health is everything.

## 11. Resource

### 11.1 Course
